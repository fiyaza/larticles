Laravel 5.5 API Using Resources

In this project, I have built an API from scratch using Laravel 5.5 API resources. I have created an article model and used seeds and factories to create dummy data and then built the api endpoints with a resource.

VUE.JS FRONTEND

I have added a Vue.js frontend to this Laravel 5.5 API. 

It is a full CRUD app with pagination and a Bootstrap 4 UI.
